#Feature: Hover states for interactive elements
#  As a user, I want to see hover states for all interactive elements, so I can easily identify what is clickable or interactive.
#
#  Scenario: Hover state for buttons
#    Given a button is visible on the page
#    When the user hovers over the button
#    Then the button’s appearance changes (e.g., changes color or adds shadow)
#
#  Scenario: Hover state for links
#    Given a link is visible on the page
#    When the user hovers over the link
#    Then the link’s appearance changes (e.g., underlines or changes color)
#
#  Scenario: Hover state for dropdowns
#    Given a dropdown menu is visible on the page
#    When the user hovers over the dropdown
#    Then the dropdown’s appearance changes (e.g., highlights or adds a border)
#
#  Scenario: Hover state consistency
#    Given multiple interactive elements (buttons, links, dropdowns) are visible on the page
#    When the user hovers over each element
#    Then the hover states are consistent across all elements
#
#  Scenario: Hover state accessibility compliance
#    Given a button is visible on the page
#    When the user hovers over the button
#    Then the hover state complies with WCAG accessibility standards
